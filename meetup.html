<h3>Thursday 31 January 2013</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Present: David, Ben, Cathie, Mark, JR</li>
	<li>Theme: Welcome to 2012! What should we do differently</li>
	<li>Outcome: We need a local project</li>
</ul>
<span>
<p>
	After most of 2012 spent on working on the 3 remote SIP software projects that are RapidFTR, OpenMRS, and Camfed, we have discussed as a group our desire to have more impact on the local communities, which would also make the session and work more appealing and rewarding. Therefore, for 2013, we have agreed to take a new direction, and find a local project we would all contribute to as a group.

	After a brainstorm on what we kind of projects, organisations, and ideas we would be willing to work for. Some examples we dreamt up were a carbon footprint metering app, a food distribution & manufacturing information app, a micro funding website, and others. Then we came to realise that there does not seem to be any local (and global?) reference of potential SIP projects that require willing hand and heads. We started discussing how cool an online index or marketplace for these kind of project would be.

So, for next session we will:
<ol>
	<li>Come up with potential local projects, ideally (but not necessarily) having contacted local communities and/or charities.</li>
	<li>Publish online an index of all those projects so that other groups like us might benefit from this information
	<li>Decide on what project we all agree, as a group, to pursue further.</li>
	<li>We are all looking forward to seeing everyone ideas in the next session. If you are new and consider joining the meetup, you are joining us at the right time as we are about to start on an exciting and rewarding venture.</li>
</ol>
